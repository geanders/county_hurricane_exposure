\caption{Summary statistics for exposure metrics considered to assess county-level exposure to
         tropical cyclones. A county exposure represents the exposure of a specific eastern U.S.  
         county to a specific tropical cyclone. A county can be exposed to multiple tropical cyclones within
         a year, and a tropical cyclone can create multiple county exposures under a given metric.
         The median and interquartile range of county exposures per tropical cyclone is based on
         the tropical cyclones for which at least one U.S. county was exposed. The years for which
         data are available for each metric are given in Table 1.}
