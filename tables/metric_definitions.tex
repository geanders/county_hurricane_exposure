Wind & 1988\,--\,2015 & Modeled maximum sustained wind speed at the county's population mean center 15 meters per second or higher during the storm\\ 
Flood & 1996\,--\,2015 & Flood event listed in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events database for the county with a start date within two days of the storm's closest approach and county population mean center within 500 kilometers of the storm track \\
