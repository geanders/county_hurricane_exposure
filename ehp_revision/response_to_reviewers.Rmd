# Overall comments {-#overall-comments}

\colorlet{shadecolor}{blue!8}
\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Associate Editor's Overview:}
Developing a consistent and comparable metric for exposure to tropical cyclones
would be a valuable addition to the literature. All reviewers had questions
about the exposure metric, including the challenges of using county-level data
where not everyone in a county would have been exposed and the difficulties of
going from country-level to individual -level risks. Further the comparison of
different storm hazards could be clarified. The reviewers identified several
issues where further explanation would increase the accessibility of the
manuscript.

## Overall comments {-#overall-comments}
\colorlet{shadecolor}{blue!8}
\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Reviewer 1 Overview:}
I applaud the authors for this work, and their efforts to develop standardized
ways to measure exposure to tropical cyclones. As a disaster scientist, I very
much appreciate efforts that promote our collective ability to learn from and
across disasters to build cumulative science. 
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Reviewer 1 (R1) Comment 1:}
I very much appreciate the rationale for authors' decision to focus at the
county level, especially given the available health-related data. But, since
tropical cyclones don't necessarily have consistent impacts across an entire
county, I think the limitations of this decision are worthy of further
discussion in the discussion section.
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 


\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R1 Comment 2:}
Are there opportunities to expand this approach internationally? Some decisions
(e.g., county-level) data may restrict cross-country comparisons. Can the
authors discuss this? 
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 


\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R1 Comment 3:}
In non-health fields, a county's inclusion in a FEMA major disaster declaration
or eligibility for public/individual assistance (all of which are somewhat
reflective of level of damage) is sometimes used as an "exposure" proxy. Have
you considered if/how your exposure assessments relate to inclusion in a FEMA
disaster declaration? In other words, does exposure to any of the hazards align
with the level of damage required for a county to be considered a "disaster
area" and/or worthy of federal assistance by current federal policy? Does this
matter?
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R1 Comment 4:}
Line 95---wondering if there is a better word for "hits" here. Maybe "exposed?"

\textit{Lines 92--95 in the original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}

\textit{"In many cases, these studies analyze multi-year, multi-community data,
allowing them to estimate average associations over many disasters and to
explore how a disaster’s characteristics, or the characteristics of the
community it hits, modify associated health risks (e.g., Anderson and Bell 2010;
Son et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2017)."}

\textit{Lines 137--141 from original manuscript:}

\textit{"While other approaches have been developed to incorporate storm
hazards, particularly wind, into exposure assessment (e.g., Grabich et al.
2015a; Zandbergen 2009; Czajkowski et al. 2011), there is not yet a standard
approach, and when different studies use different datasets or storm hazards
when assessing storm exposure, it becomes difficult to compare and aggregate
findings."}

\textbf{R1 Comment 6:}
This is not a comment on the paper, but the authors may also want to consider
publishing their work in DesignSafe, which is "the web-based research platform
of the NHERI  [NSF-Funded Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure]
Network that provides the computational tools needed to manage, analyze, and
understand critical data for natural hazards research." It is the data
repository widely used by interdisciplinary hazards and disaster researchers.

# Reviewer 2: {-#reviewer-2}

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Reviewer 2 overview:}
Exposure assessment is essential to study health impacts from disasters, but it
is also a great source of biases due to a lack of a good and fine measure of
exposures during the chaos. Often, epidemiologists use existing data at large
population level such as county level weather data which provide no individual
level exposures but give average exposure at the population level. So it is very
challenging to draw a good causal inference to health outcomes that measured at
the individual level. This manuscript is a well-written report with generously
shared data and programs on US tropical cyclones. This will contribute
significantly to disaster epidemiology which is still a new area and suffering
from good exposure ascertainment.

While I enjoyed reading the manuscript very much, I have one question I could
not figure out clearly.

One objective is to investigate patterns and agreement between different
exposure measures. I do not clearly understand the value of studying agreement
between exposures, while each exposure should be measured separately, so both
individual and overall effects can be assessed.  I do understand using "distance
from the storm" as exposure is only proxy measure and highly sensitive to
misclassification, but because direct storm hazards such as rainfall, flood,
storm surge, and tornado are publicly accessible as authors indicated, authors
could just simply guide readers to use the best exposure data rather than
conducting a quite intense analysis. This may be due to my limited knowledge, so
it would be appreciated if the authors provide explicit explanations on the
purpose and benefit of the analysis.

\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Reviewer 2 (R2) Comment 1:}
Line 164: Isn’t it obvious to use better exposure measures than proxies? Wind,
rainfall, tornado, and flood are direct products of storms while distance is
only proxy of those exposures. Rather than calculating agreement among the
exposures, it would be important to note that these are independent hazards that
can come together or come with different intensity and at different time
windows.

\textit{Lines 164--166 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"They found important differences, concluding that a study may be prone
to bias from exposure misclassification if distance to the storm track is used
as a proxy for exposure (Grabich et al. 2015a)."}
\end{quotation}
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 2:}
Line 354: I am not sure why different exposures should be compared and measured
the agreement. I would just treat each exposure as single independent exposure
and give a summary score by summing all the exposure with some weighting for
multiple exposures.

I may not understand the importance of this approach. If so, adding the
explanation would help readers not to questioning.

\textit{Line 354 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"Finally, we investigated how well exposure assessment agreed across
these metrics."}
\end{quotation}
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 3:}
Line 394: It looks like the correlation coefficients can be very low if measured
from 75mm or somewhere around.  This seems to be a significant issue for
analyzing storms with heavier rainfall using NLDAS-2 data.

\textit{Line 392--394 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"Within these counties, storm-related rainfall measurements were
well-correlated between the two data sources, with rank correlations (bottom
right of each graph in Figure 2) between 0.87 and 0.98. "}

Figure 4: I would add Y-axis label “NOAA classification."
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 5:}
Table 2: This is another confusing table. Not sure what compared here. The
second column is a mean \# of exposed counties over years and the third column
seems like showing single storm with the max \# of exposed counties. Not sure
what info I should digest from this table.
\end{shaded}

> **Text from Results of original manuscript:**
"Across the four storm hazards considered, there was wide variation in the
average number of county exposures per year (Table 2). For tropical cyclone
tornadoes, there were on average about 40 county exposures per year within our
study. County exposures were more frequent for tropical cyclone wind exposures
(>160/year on average), even more frequent for tropical cyclone flood exposures
(>190/year on average), and most frequent for tropical cyclone rain exposure
(>290/year on average). For every hazard except tornadoes, we identified at
least one tropical cyclone that exposed over 250 counties (Table 2). However,
the largest-extent tropical cyclone varied across hazards: Frances in 2004
exposed the most counties based on rain, Michael in 2018 based on wind, and Ivan
in 2004 based on flooding and tornadoes (Table 2)."

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 6:}
Subsection of Results on \textit{Agreement across exposure metrics}: 
As stated below, storms bring different hazards to different locations with
different time. What would be new learning by comparing these different pairs of
exposure metrics. Somewhat apple and orange comparison. Maybe providing more
explanation can help what the important learning from this is. I may not catch
it. Similar comment was added earlier.
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 7:}
Lines 494--495: Why this agreement is important? Same questions added above
already, but still wonder what I missed. It seems like the authors try to
develop an exposure matrix that is common in occupational epidemiology, but it
is only valid method when the exposures are similar and lead to the same health
outcomes.  Rain, wind, flood, and tornado should be treated separately, maybe
except rain and flood. It is possible to be an extreme storm with only severe
wind without major impacts from other exposures. Tornado is a good example.

\textit{Line 491--495 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"For another set of tropical cyclones (e.g., Ernesto in 2006, and Bertha
in 1996, Isabel in 2003), there was moderate to good agreement for pairwise
combinations of distance, rain, and wind, but poor agreement for other
combinations of metrics, while for another set of storms (e.g., Matthew in 2004
and Katrina in 2005), there was moderate to good agreement between distance and
rain."}
\end{quotation}
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 8:}
Line 515: It would be informative to provide correlation coefficient for only
above 75 mm measures.

\textit{Line 514--515 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"The rainfall data are generally well-correlated with ground-based
observations, but may sometimes underestimate very high rainfall values (Figure
2)."}
\end{quotation}
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 9:}
Line 602: This is not a new finding, but how much misclassified would be a good
question to answer.

\textit{Line 600--602 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"Based on our results, the use of a distance-based metric to assess
exposure to any of these hazards, or the use of measurements from one hazard as
a proxy for exposure to any of the other hazards considered, would often
introduce exposure misclassification."}
\end{quotation}
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 10:}
Lines 626--627: It would still be beneficial to treat each exposure as a single
variable first and then consider overall impact. Only if each exposure data are
available.

\textit{Line 626--628 from original manuscript:}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{"For these storms, it may be possible to assess exposure to multiple
hazards of the storm using a single metric, perhaps even a proxy like the
distance between the county and the storm’s track."}

# Reviewer 3: {-#reviewer-3}

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Reviewer 3 overview:}
This paper describes the development of a dataset and R package that can be used
to assess exposure to tropical cyclone-related hazards (e.g., wind,
precipitation, flooding) at the county level in the eastern United States, as
well as a descriptive analysis of county-level exposure to these hazards. This R
package is novel and I believe of high interest to researchers interested in the
health effects of tropical cyclones.  I have a few minor suggestions to further
improve the clarity of the manuscript.
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{Reviewer 3 (R3) Comment 1:}
Starting on line 128, the authors write "Extreme winds are more common to the
track's right, where counterclockwise cyclonic winds move in concert with the
tropical cyclone's forward motion". I think this statement may be specific to
tropical cyclones in the Northern hemisphere (i.e., those relevant to exposure
in the US). Would be good to clarify this.

\textbf{R2 Comment 3:}
Several of the exposures are calculated for the population mean center of each
county. From the reference list, it looks like the authors consistently used
population centers from 2010 throughout the years included in the dataset/R
package. If so, I suggest clarifying this in the text.

**Response:**

\textbf{R2 Comment 4:}
In the methods section starting on line 276, the authors describe the flooding
and tornado data from the NOAA storm events database. I'd suggest providing some
information about where the events in this database come from (e.g., that they
are reported events) here in addition to covering it in the discussion.

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{EHP Request 1:}
Figure 3: Please truncate x-axis scale as you do for Figure S7. Since smallest

Main text figures (general)
To ensure that figures are accessible to readers with impaired color vision, do not use color as the sole means of conveying information in a figure unless absolutely necessary. Use different symbols, shading/textures, and line patterns instead of (or in addition to) color to distinguish among different data points. Use contrasting colors that can be easily distinguished from each other when the figure is printed in black and white. For details, see: \url{https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/authors/figures}.
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 3:}
Figure 3: Please check the contrast between the colors used to indicate numbers
of counties. If you can see the gradient when printed in black and white it
should be ok, but some of the differences are very subtle. Truncating the x-axis
might help with this (if possible.)
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 4:}
Figure 4: Even with nominally normal color vision and a large high-resolution
monitor, it is difficult for me to make out the color differences in the
symbols-- almost all appear black or very dark blue, a dozen or so look yellow,
and a handful look dark grey. Is there any way to increase the contrast in these
colors? Would you consider binning into categories instead of using a
continuous color gradient?
\end{shaded}

**Response:** 

\begin{shaded}
\textbf{R2 Comment 5:}
Figures 5--6: Please check to see if the colors used can be distinguished if
printed in black and white, and if not, use a “color-blind friendly” palette if
possible. If this is not feasible, we can request and exemption from
accessibility requirements, but we try to do this only when alternatives  would
degrade the information content of  the figure.
