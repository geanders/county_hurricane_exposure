We interpolated this data to~15-\si {\minute } increments and assessed a county as exposed to winds at or above one of these cutoffs if its population mean center was within~85\% of the maximum radius for that wind speed in its quadrant of the storm. For each county in each of the available storms, we also calculated the modeled wind speed~\citep {stormwindmodel} and then categorized this value into the same categories available for the \ac {HURDAT2} wind radii ($<$34~\si {\knot }; 34\,--\,49.9~\si {\knot }; 50\,--\,63.9~\si {\knot }; $\ge $64~\si {\knot }). Each point in this graph shows, for a storm, the percent of counties in which the wind category ($<$34~\si {\knot }; 34\,--\,49.9~\si {\knot }; 50\,--\,63.9~\si {\knot }; $\ge $64~\si {\knot }) was the same based on both modeled winds and the \ac {HURDAT2} wind radii. Only storms with at least one county with sustained wind of~$\ge $34 \si {\knot }, based on the \ac {HURDAT2} wind radii, are shown. Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Ike (2008) were he two storms with the worst agreement between these two sets of wind data; maps with further comparisons between the two data sources for these two storms are given in Figure~\ref {fig:windexamples}}{figure.5}{}}

Each small graph shows a sample county, and each point on the graph represents a tropical storm that came within~500 \si {\kilo \metre } of the population mean center of the county. The x-axis shows the estimated cumulative rainfall (in millimeters) from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach to the county based on the county-aggregated \ac {NLDAS-2} recipitation data used to measure rain exposure in our main analysis. The ground-based observations (y-axis) are based on collecting precipitation data from available weather stations in the county, 1988\,--\,2011, summed over the same period from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach for each available station. These cumulative station-based precipitation totals were then averaged across all available stations in the county to create a county-wide estimate of cumulative storm-related precipitation for each storm in the county. Horizontal and vertical lines show the threshold used to classify a storm as exposed based on cumulative rainfall; storms in the lower left and upper right quadrants are classified the same regardless of whether reanalysis or station-based precipitation data is considered, while storms in the upper left and lower right quadrants would be classified differently. The number of storms within each county and the average number of stations reporting rainfall during the county's storms are given above each plot. Note that x- and y-axis ranges differ by county. An estimate of the rank correlation (Spearman's~$\rho $~\citep  {spearman1904proof}) between measurements from the two rain data sources is also shown on each graph.}}{29}{figure.6}}
