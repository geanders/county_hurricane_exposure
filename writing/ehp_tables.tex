Wind & 1988--2015 & Modeled maximum sustained wind speed at the county's population mean center 15 meters per second or higher during the storm\\ 
Flood & 1996--2015 & Flood event listed in the \ac{NOAA} Storm Events database for the county with a start date within two days of the storm's closest approach and county population mean center within 500 \si{\kilo\metre} of the storm track \\
Tornado & 1996--2015 & Tornado event listed in the \ac{NOAA} Storm Events database for the county with a start date within two days of the storm's closest approach and county population mean center within 500 \si{\kilo\metre} of the storm track\\
