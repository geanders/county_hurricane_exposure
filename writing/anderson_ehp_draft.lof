\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Heatmap of Jaccard index values for specific exposure metric pairs within storms. Only storms between 1996 and 2011, and for which at least 250 counties were exposed based on at least one metric, are included. The color of each cell within the main heatmap indicates the value of the Jaccard index (proportion of counties classified as exposed by both metrics out of storms classified as exposed by either metric) for a given pair of metrics for a given storm. Storms are displayed within clusters that have similar patterns in county-level exposure agreement for metric pairs, based on hierarchical clustering using the complete link method \cite {murtagh2012algorithms} (i.e., storms in the same cluster tend to have similar patterns for the pairwise strength of agreement among metrics); columns are also ordered based on hierarchical clustering. The colors to the right of the main heatmap for each storm indicate the total number of counties classified as exposed to the storm by any of the five metrics, providing an estimate of storm extent. Maps are available showing the counties identified as exposed under each of five metrics for the widest-extent storm in each cluster: Hurricane Ivan (2004) (Fig. \ref {fig:ivanexposure}) and Hurricanes Floyd (1999), Lee (2011), Cindy (2005), and Katrina (2005) (Fig. S3).}}{19}{figure.2}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Average number of storm exposures per decade in U.S. counties for each exposure metric. The criteria behind each of the five metrics is given in Table \ref {tab:exposuremetrics}. The years used to estimate these averages are based on years of available exposure data (distance and wind: 1988--2015; rain: 1988--2011; flood and tornado: 1996--2015). Similar patterns persist when analysis is restricted to years with all exposure data available (1996--2011; Fig. S5).}}{20}{figure.3}
