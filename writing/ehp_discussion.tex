\section*{Discussion}

Tropical cyclones impact public health in many ways, and epidemiological
studies of the health risk and impacts associated with tropical cyclone
exposures could help improve preparedness for and response to future tropical
cyclones.  However, tropical cyclones are multi-hazard events, making it
complicated to measure exposure. Here, we provide open-source county-level data
on multiple storm exposure metrics, and we find that county-level tropical
cyclone exposure assessments vary substantially when using a distance-based
metric versus four hazard-based metrics, as well as among different
hazard-based metrics. Our results can inform exposure assessment for future
county-level studies of the health risks and impacts associated with tropical
cyclones exposures, and the open-source data and software we have created
provides multi-hazard, county-level exposure data for such studies.

\subsection*{Exposure assessment data and software}

In creating this hurricane exposure dataset, we aimed for data that are
available for all eastern \ac{US} counties. In addition to providing tropical
cyclone exposure metrics for individual hazards, this data and its associated
software allow users not only to access measurements for single hazards, but
also to create tropical cyclone exposure profiles based on multiple hazards or
craft exposure indices that combine hazard
metrics~\parencite{chakraborty2005population, peduzzi2009assessing}. This
ability can be critical, as different hazards of tropical cyclones often act
synergistically in causing impacts~\parencite{smith2009}.  

\begin{comment}
To assist with future tropical cyclone studies, we created and published open
source software with this dataset and accompanying
tools~\parencite{hurricaneexposuredata, hurricaneexposure}.  Many previous
studies have used geographical information system software (e.g., ArcGIS) to
assess exposure to tropical cyclones in the \ac{US}~\parencite{grabich2016,
zandbergen2009, czajkowski2011, kruk2010}.  Here, we offer methods to map and
output historic exposure to tropical cyclones that does not require the use of
proprietary software but instead uses a package written in the R statistical
programming language~\parencite{R}, which is free and open-source.  Further, by
including measurements of different hazard exposures in each county for each
tropical cyclone, this software allows for the development of more complex
exposure indices or models (e.g., random forests, multivariable generalized
linear models) that incorporate multiple tropical cyclone hazard measurements.  
\end{comment}

We investigated how well these data correspond with data from other available
sources (Figures~\ref{fig:windcomparison}\,--\,\ref{fig:floodcomparison}
and~S6\,--\,7). While generally in agreement with data from other sources,
there are a few caveats that should be considered when applying these data in
future studies. The rainfall data are from re-analysis data are generally
well-correlated with observed ground-based station data, but may sometimes
oversmooth very high rainfall values compared to ground-based observations
(Figure~\ref{fig:raincomparison}). When rainfall data is used to create binary
exposure classifications, this disagreement is unlikely to influence results,
as both data sources agree in identifying these as storms with high rainfall,
but it may be important to consider for cases that include rainfall as a
continuous measurement. 

The wind data are based on modeled, rather than observed, values, and while the
modeled wind data generally agree well with post-analysis maximum wind radii
from \ac{HURDAT2}~\parencite{landsea2013} (Figure~\ref{fig:windcomparison}),
there were a few storms where the two datasets did not agree as well ($<$90\%
of counties classified into the same wind categories by the two sources of wind
estimates). These storms were exceptionally large systems for which high winds
persisted well inland from landfall, like Hurricanes Sandy and Ike
(Figures~\ref{fig:windcomparison} and\~S6). Since the wind radii are based on
\ldots, they have [advantages]; their main disadvantages is that they provide
categorical, rather than continuous, estimates of wind speed, and in many cases
researchers might prefer more precise estimates of storm wind speeds. However,
since the wind radii data may be useful in some cases as either a primary
metric or for sensitivity analysis, we have include county-level wind estimates
for each storm based on these wind radii, in addition to the continuous modeled
windspeeds, in the open-source data \cite{hurricaneexposuredata}.

For the flooding events data, we found it often corresponded with measurements
from \ac{US} Geographical Survey streamgages, with flood event listings more
likely during storms which elevated stream flows. However, there are
differences between the two flooding datasets, and these highlight both the
difficulty of measuring flood exposure at the county level and inherent
challenges in using the storm event database for epidemiologic exposure
assessment.  The flood and tornado data came from the \ac{NOAA} Storm Events
database, which, while a widely-used database of events maintained by
\ac{NOAA}, is based on reports, and so may be prone to
underreporting~\parencite{Ashley2008flood, Curran2000}, especially in less
populated areas~\parencite{Witt1998, Ashley2007}, as well as to other reporting
errors. 

\begin{comment}
[For discussion?] Based on these results, the two data sources were generally
in agreement, but the analysis highlights the difficulty of assessing
storm-related flooding at a multi-county, multi-year scale, as flooding can be
very localized within a county or can \ldots .   
\end{comment}

While these are important caveats for the data, we selected these data sources
as among the best currently available for measuring each of these hazards at a
multi-county, multi-year scale.

\subsection*{Patterns in tropical cyclone exposures}

We found geographic patterns in tropical cyclones based on the different
exposure metrics that. These patterns were not unexpected based on what is
known about tropical cyclone hazards, but still highlight variations across
metrics that are critical to consider in designing studies for tropical cyclone
epidemiology, and they demonstrate the need for multi-hazard exposure datasets
for tropical cyclone epidemiology. Wind-based exposures had a strong coastal
pattern, which is consistent with the dramatic decrease in wind intensity that
typically characterizes the landfall of tropical cyclones. Exposures by rain-
and distance-based metrics often extended further inland compared to the
wind-based metric, up to the Appalachian mountains. This agrees with previous
research indicating that the Appalachian mountains' topography both enhances
precipitation during tropical cyclones and provides hydrological conditions for
severe flooding~\parencite{rees2001}.  Almost all tornado-based exposures were
in southern coastal states, echoing previous findings that most noteworthy
tropical cyclone-related tornadoes occur on the right-side of the tropical
cyclone track in Atlantic-basin \ac{US} storms~\parencite{moore2012}.  These
exposure averages are somewhat limited as estimates of long-term frequencies,
as tropical cyclones follow decadal patterns~\parencite{kossin2007more} likely
not adequately captured in the available data. However, exposure assessments
spanning over a century have found similar patterns for distance- and
wind-based metrics~\textcite{zandbergen2009, kruk2010} [double-check that refs
found similar patterns].

\begin{comment}
However, these frequency maps, together with evidence from
specific tropical cyclones (Figures~\ref{fig:ivanexposure}
and~\ref{fig:jaccard}),  do illustrate the potential for strong differences in
spatial patterns in tropical cyclone exposures, depending on which tropical
cyclone hazards are considered.  A few previous studies have sought to
determine county-level exposure to tropical cyclones over multi-year periods,
including~\textcite{zandbergen2009}, which estimated exposure in \ac{US}
counties to all \ac{US} landfalling Atlantic-basin tropical cyclones
between~1851 and~2003, using both a distance-based metric and a metric that
combined distance and windspeed, and~\textcite{kruk2010}, which explored
exposure to hurricane-related winds in the \ac{US}, including inland areas,
for~1900\,--\,2008.  Our results suggest that such exposure assessments may
perform well in capturing some tropical cyclone hazards (e.g., wind), but
likely miss other potentially dangerous tropical cyclone exposures, especially
for hazards that repeatedly threaten northern or inland counties (e.g., rain,
flooding).
\end{comment}

\subsection*{Agreement between exposure metrics}

We found that there was typically only moderate or low agreement between
county-level exposure classifications for a tropical cyclone when comparing
different exposure metrics. This suggests that the use of one of these metrics
as a proxy for all storm-based hazards in epidemiological research would often
be problematic, introducing exposure misclassification.

\begin{comment}
For example, distance from a tropical cyclone's track is relatively easy to
measure and has been used as an operational metric of exposure to tropical
cyclones in previous large-scale studies (examples include ...). Since distance
itself does not constitute a hazard, distance is meant in these cases as a
surrogate to capture exposure to hazards from the tropical cyclone. However,
here we found that in assessing \ac{US} county-level exposure to tropical
cyclones, distance is, at best, a moderate, and often a very poor, surrogate
for exposure to the specific tropical cyclone hazards of high wind, extreme
rainfall, flooding, and tornadoes (Figure~\ref{fig:jaccard}). Therefore, use of
distance to assess tropical cyclone exposure for impact studies could result in
problematic exposure misclassification, which could mask true associations,
even strong associations, between tropical cyclone exposure and outcomes of
interest in impact studies~\parencite{savitz2016interpreting,
armstrong1998effect}.  
\end{comment}

These findings align with previous results from atmospheric science and related
fields on the characteristics of tropical cyclones. While tropical cyclone
rainfall and windspeed are often well-correlated when the tropical cyclone is
over water~\parencite{cerveny2000}, this relationship often does not remain as
strong once the hurricane has made landfall~\parencite{jiang2008}.  Fast-moving
tropical cyclones bring higher risks of dangerous winds
inland~\parencite{kruk2010}, while slow-moving tropical cyclone are likely to
bring more rain~\parencite{rappaport2000} and cause more damage because of
sustained hazardous conditions~\parencite{rezapour2014}. Further, while the
likelihood and extent of flooding during a tropical cyclone is related to the
tropical cyclone's rainfall, it is also driven by factors like top soil
saturation and the structure of the water basin's drainage
network~\parencite{chen2015, rees2001}. 

However, we did find a small set of tropical cyclones for which for which
agreement between metrics were unusually high (e.g., Floyd in~1999, Irene in
2011, Hannah in~2008, Bertha in~1996).  Hurricanes Floyd in~1999 and Irene
in~2011 both made their first \ac{US} landfall in North Carolina at minor
hurricane windspeeds (Category~2 and~1, respectively) and then skimmed the
eastern coast of the \ac{US} north through New England, bringing large rainfall
to much of the eastern coast from North Carolina north and causing extensive
inland flooding in North Carolina (Floyd) and New England
(Irene)~\parencite{avila2013atlantic, lawrence2000atlantic}.  Hurricanes Hannah
in~2008 and Bertha in~1996 followed the eastern coastline north of North
Carolina in a pattern similar to Floyd and Irene. For this set of storms, the
tropical cyclones' persistent proximity to water may have helped maintain wind
speeds in similar patterns to rain and distance exposures, resulting in this
moderate to good agreement among exposure assessments based on different
metrics. 

In some cases, exposure misclassification from using one of these exposure
metrics to capture one or more of the other storm hazards may be differential
(i.e., associated with the outcome of interest or with factors associated with
risk of the outcome of interest). For example, tropical cyclone wind exposures
tend to be concentrated in counties near the coast, since most tropical
cyclones rapidly decrease in their sustained windspeed following landfall.
However, tropical cyclone exposures based on distance can extend well inland,
following the tropical cyclone's tracks, but may not adequately capture all
wind-exposed counties near the coast. In this case, if the
etiologically-relevant exposure is high wind but exposure is classified based
on distance, the probability of being misclassified as unexposed would be
higher in coastal counties, while the probability of being misclassified as
exposed would be higher in inland counties. If coastal counties differ from
inland counties in either the outcome of interest or in factors associated with
risk of that outcome, differential exposure misclassification would
exist~\parencite{savitz2016interpreting}. Such differential exposure
misclassification can bias estimates of tropical cyclone effects either towards
the null (estimating a lower or null association compared to the true
association that exists) or away from the null (estimating a larger association
than actually exists)~\parencite{savitz2016interpreting, armstrong1998effect}.

\begin{comment}
The use of a single hazard-based metric (e.g., wind) could cause similar
problems if the impact is driven, at least in part, by a different hazard or by
multiple hazards of the tropical cyclone.
\end{comment}

\subsection*{Case study}

The conducted case study demonstrates how differences in exposure assessment
across storm exposure metrics can result in differing estimates of expected
physical exposure to tropical cyclones among a population
(Figure~\ref{fig:topelecdependexposure}).  Previous assessments of physical
exposure to tropical cyclones have often focused on solely storm winds and
storm proximity. For example, a global study of exposure and vulnerability to
natural hazards used a combination of windspeed above a certain threshold and
distance from the storm's track to assess
exposure~\parencite{peduzzi2009assessing}. While many storm impacts might be
most strongly linked to wind hazards, there is a growing recognition of the
potential risks of adverse health outcomes and property damage from rain- and
flood-related tropical cyclone hazards in the \ac{US}~\parencite{smith2009}.
Such assessments may underemphasize potentially dangerous exposures to certain
regions of the \ac{US}, particularly inland locations. In fact, based on our
assessment of physical exposures to tropical cyclones among
electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries, the highest expected physical
exposure under any metric was measured for Philadelphia County, PA, under the
flood metric (Figure~\ref{fig:topelecdependexposure}).  While this county has a
similar-sized population of electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries as
Miami-Dade County, FL (Figure~\ref{fig:topelecdependexposure}), the frequency
of storm-related flood events in this inland county results in a very high
expected physical exposure among this subpopulation, while this county is not
included in the top ten counties for physical exposure based on most of the
other exposure metrics.

\subsection*{Conclusions}

Previous research has highlighted the range of impacts that tropical cyclones
can have in \ac{US} communities. However, studies have varied widely in how they
assess exposure to tropical cyclones for exposure, health impact, and other
impact studies, in some cases using distance to the tropical cyclone's track as
a surrogate metric of exposure to a tropical cyclone's hazards. Here we found
large differences in which counties are exposed to different hazards of
tropical cyclones and that distance is, at best, a moderate, and often a very
poor, surrogate for exposure to the specific tropical cyclone hazards of high
wind, extreme rainfall, flooding, and tornadoes. Use of distance as a surrogate
for any of these hazards could lead to exposure misclassification and, in the
case of tropical cyclone risk and impact studies, including epidemiological
studies, result in biased estimates.  Similarly, if such studies disagree on
their findings, it could result from the often poor agreement between exposure
classifications based on these different metrics, making studies that use
different metrics hard to compare or combine in meta-analyses. Our findings
highlight the importance of clarifying the potential pathway from tropical
cyclone hazards to health impacts when conducting tropical cyclone
epidemiological studies and basing exposure assessment on measurements of these
hazards. To help with this, we provide extensive tropical cyclone
hazard-related measurements for a large collection of historical Atlantic-basin
cyclones, aggregated at the county level to align with the spatial scale at
which much health-related data is collected.
