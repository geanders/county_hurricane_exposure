Abstract Background: Tropical cyclones bring severe impacts to United States (US) communities, including substantial human health risks, from hazards that include wind, rain, flooding, and tornadoes. However, studies quantifying tropical cyclone risks and impacts vary widely in how they classify exposure to tropical cyclones, using various hazard-based metrics and, in some cases, using distance from the storm track as a surrogate. Objectives: (1) Investigate how well county-level assessments of tropical cyclone exposure agree when based on distance versus hazard-based measurements, as well as among assessments based on different hazard measurements, and (2) provide software to improve tropical cyclone exposure assessment for health-related research. Methods: We measured county-level exposure to tropical cyclones in the US based on distance from the storm track, maximum sustained wind, rainfall, flooding, and tornadoes for all landfalling or near-land Atlantic basin storms, for 1996 ­ 2011 for all metrics and up to 1988 ­ 2015 for specific metrics. We quantified how well county-level exposure assessment agreed for all pairwise combinations of metrics. Results: In most of the storms investigated, agreement in county-level exposure assessment was at best moderate, and often poor, when using distance compared with four hazard-based measurements. There was also substantial disagreement in exposure assessment based on all pairwise combinations of the four hazard-based measurements. There were geographic patterns in exposures based on these metrics, with most wind-based exposures near the coast, flood- and rain-based exposures extending to inland and northern counties, and tornado-based exposures in southern counties. Discussion: Our results suggest that when impact studies use distance as a surrogate for tropical cyclone exposure, or use one hazard-based metric when the impact is partly or fully caused by a different hazard, the study will be prone to exposure misclassification. To facilitate future research, we make this multi-hazard storm exposure data available through open-source software.

Introduction
Tropical cyclones, including hurricanes, can have disastrous impacts in the United States (US). A tropical cyclone's high winds can bring health risks and property damage through structural damage of houses and other buildings, falling trees, and wind-borne debris (Rappaport 2000) and cause power outages (Liu et al. 2005; Han et al. 2009), which introduce a number of threats to human and ecological health, including water quality risks if the outage affects wastewater treatment plants (Mallin and Corbett 2006). Other risks can exist without severe wind; for example, one study found that most of the direct hurricane-related deaths in the US between 1970 and 1999 occurred in cases when wind was below hurricane strength, including for Tropical Storms Charley in 1998 and Alberto in 1994 (Rappaport 2000). Tropical cyclones can produce excessive rain, especially in certain topographies (e.g., near mountains), so counties well inland sometimes experience more extreme rain than coastal counties. Flood risks from tropical cyclones can result from this rain, although the two risks are not perfectly correlated (X. Chen, Kumar, and McGlynn 2015). In the US, over half of hurricane-related direct deaths from 1970 to 1999 from Atlantic basin storms were a result of freshwater flooding (Rappaport 2000). Flooding can also degrade water quality (Mallin and Corbett 2006), which can threaten both human and ecological health. To measure tropical cyclone exposure for either investigations of exposure patterns or for estimation of tropical cyclone risks and impacts, including those related to human health, studies have varied widely in how they determine tropical cyclone exposure (some examples shown in Figure S1). While some studies have measured exposure based on specific hazards of the tropical cyclone (e.g., wind, rain), many have used distance from the tropical cyclone's central track as a surrogate in identifying exposure to the hazards of a tropical cyclone (e.g., Czajkowski, Simmons, and Sutter (2011), Tansel and Sizirici (2010), Kinney et al. (2008), and Caillou¨ et et al. (2008)). Distance from the tropical cyclone's central track can be easily measured using widelyavailable hurricane tracking data. There are, however, a number of limitations to using distance to assess exposure to tropical cyclones, and there are reasons to suspect that exposure classifications based on other tropical cyclone hazards may disagree with distance-based classifications. Tropical cyclones vary dramatically in size: US tropical cyclones have been observed with radii to maximum winds as small as 20 km and as large as 200 km (Mallin and Corbett 2006; S. Quiring et al. 2011). While a number of tropical cyclone hazards are strongly associated with distance from the tropical cyclone's center (e.g., wind and, at the coast, storm surge and waves (Rappaport 2000; Kruk et al. 2010)), other hazards like dangerous rain, floods, and tornadoes can occur well away from the tropical cyclone's central track (Rappaport 2000; E. Atallah, Lance F Bosart, and Aiyyer 2007; Moore and Dixon 2012). For example, fatal tropical cyclone tornadoes, which were linked to over 300 deaths in the US between 1995 and 2009, most often occur 200 ­ 500 km from the tropical cyclone's center (Moore and Dixon 2012). Further, distance-based exposure metrics that use buffers tend to use an equal buffer distance on each side of the tropical cyclone track (e.g., Czajkowski, Simmons, and Sutter 2011; Grabich, Robinson, et al. 2015; Grabich, Horney, et al. 2016; Zandbergen 2009; Tansel and Sizirici 2010), but the forces of a tropical cyclone tend to be distributed around the center in a non-symmetrical way. For example, extreme winds are more common to the right of the track, where counterclockwise cyclonic winds move in concert with the tropical cyclone's forward motion (Halverson 2015), and the fatal tornadoes associated with US tropical cyclones between 1995 and 2009 occurred almost exclusively to the right of the tropical cyclone's track, mostly in the right front quadrant of the tropical cyclone (Moore and Dixon 2012). Rain, conversely, is often heaviest to the left of the tropical cyclone's track, especially when the tropical cyclone interacts with other weather systems (E. H. Atallah and Lance F. Bosart 2003; E. Atallah, Lance F Bosart, and Aiyyer 2007; Zhu and S. M. Quiring 2013) or undergoes an extratropical transition (Elsberry 2002).
Something about difference in other metrics

The use of different exposure metrics across studies hampers the development of a scientific consensus on tropical cyclone-related risks, as differences observed between studies could result from differences in exposure assessment. Further, if a study misclassifies exposure to the hazard or hazards that cause an impact, estimates of tropical cyclone risks or impacts will be biased, making it hard to identify true associations. These concerns are particularly important if there are large differences in the locations that are determined to be exposed based on different metrics. To investigate this, we measured county-level exposure to tropical cyclones in all eastern US counties using five metrics (Table 1): (1) distance to tropical cyclone track; (2) maximum sustained wind speed; (3) cumulative rainfall; (4) flood events; and (5) tornado events. We assessed exposure at the county level since data on many potential impacts are available at county-level aggregations (e.g., direct hurricane-related deaths (Czajkowski, Simmons, and Sutter 2011); birth outcomes (Grabich, Robinson, et al. 2015; Grabich, Horney, et al. 2016); autism prevalence (Kinney et al. 2008)) and since decisions and policies to prepare for, and respond to, tropical cyclones are often undertaken at the county level (Zandbergen 2009; Rappaport 2000). We explored patterns in these exposure assessments and measured how well exposure classification agreed across these five metrics in terms of classifying specific counties as exposed to a tropical cyclone. Finally, to make this hazard-specific tropical cyclone exposure data available to other researchers, we published open source software for county-based hurricane exposure assessment in US counties (Anderson, Yan, et al. 2017).

Methods and Materials
All counties in the eastern half of the US (Figure 1), as of the 2010 US Decennial Census, were included in the study. The study covered all tracked storms in the revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT 2) (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013) that came within 250 km of at least one study county between 1988 and 2015 (Figure S2). HURDAT 2 is a post-storm assessment conducted by the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) and incorporates data from a variety of sources, including satellite data and, when available, aircraft reconnaissance data (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013; Jarvinen and Caso 1978). These data typically give measurements of the tropical cyclone center's location at 6-h intervals at synoptic times (i.e., 6:00 am, 12:00 pm, 6:00 pm, and 12:00 am Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)); some landfalling tropical cyclones have an additional observation at the time of landfall (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013).

Distance-based exposure metric
For each storm, the distance of closest approach was measured for every study county. Storm center track location data from HURDAT 2 were interpolated using natural cubic splines to 15-min intervals (Anderson, Yan, et al. 2017). The distance between each county's population mean center, as assessed by the 2010 Decennial Census (US Census Bureau 2015), and each 15min interpolated storm center location was measured using Great Circle (WGS84 ellipsoid) distance (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gomez-Rubio 2013). The distance-based exposure metric was based on the minimum value of this storm center-to-county distance throughout the period the storm was tracked. The time of closest approach for each county-storm pairing was also recorded for use assessing rain-, flood-, and tornado-based metrics. To allow matching with data based on local time, times were converted from UTC to local time (Anderson and Guo 2016).

Rain-based exposure metric
For the rain-based exposure metric, cumulative rainfall was estimated for the period from two days before to one day after the date of a tropical cyclone's closest approach to a county. Daily county-level rainfall was determined by aggregating hourly 1/8 gridded reanalysis data

from the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS -2) precipitation data files (Rui and Mocko 2014). The NLDAS -2 data integrate satellite-based and land-based monitoring, applying a land-surface model to create a reanalysis dataset that is spatially and temporally complete across the continental US (Rui and Mocko 2014; Al-Hamdan et al. 2014). To aggregate to county-level, hourly data at each grid point were summed to create a daily rainfall total, and these grid point rainfall totals were then averaged across all grid points within a county's 1990 US Census boundaries to create a county-level daily total (Al-Hamdan et al. 2014; US CDC 2016). This county-level precipitation data are publicly available through the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)'s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research (WONDER) database (US CDC 2016; Al-Hamdan et al. 2014). The rainfall-based exposure metric was only available for tropical cyclones through 2011, the period for which the county-aggregated reanalysis rainfall data were available (US CDC 2016; Al-Hamdan et al. 2014). To assess the rainfall estimates from the reanalysis data used in analysis in the the main text, we compared cumulative rainfall estimates based on this reanalysis rainfall data to rainfall observations from ground-based weather stations in nine sample study counties, selected as counties with data available from multiple stations. In these nine counties, observed rainfall was collected for all storms, 1988 ­ 2011, for the same period of two days before to one day after each storm's closest approach, using all stations with available daily data in the Global Historical Climatology Network throughout 1988 ­ 2011 (Menne et al. 2012; Chamberlain 2017; Severson and Anderson 2016). Agreement between measured storm-related rainfall between these two data sources was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation.

Wind-based exposure metric
Ground-based observations of wind speed are problematic during tropical cyclones, as instruments often fail at high wind speed, while reanalysis data, often available at hourly or higher resolution, can be too smooth to capture wind extremes associated with a tropical cyclone. Therefore, to create a dataset of county-level sustained winds during historical tropical cyclones, we modeled maximum sustained wind speeds at each county's population mean center (US Census Bureau 2015). HURDAT 2 Best Track data were interpolated from 6-h reported values to 15-min increments using natural cubic splines (Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017), and then sustained wind speed was modeled for each county center at each 15-min increment using a double exponential wind speed model (Willoughby, Darling, and Rahn 2006) to estimate maximum ground-level sustained wind speed at each county center (Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017). Asymmetry in wind speeds around the tropical cyclone center was incorporated into the wind speed model (Phadke et al. 2003; Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017). The maximum value of this modeled wind speed was determined for each county as the maximum windspeed across the 15-min incremented modeled values throughout the tropical cyclone. To validate the metric of county-level wind speed used in the main text, we compared this wind metric to estimated wind radii from HURDAT 2, available for storms in our study from 2004 (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013). HURDAT 2 gives estimates of the maximum radii to winds of 64, 50, and 34 kn in each four quadrants of a storm (i.e., distance from the storm's center to the furthest point in a quadrant with winds at or above that speed) at each 6-h storm observation.

Flood- and tornado-based exposure metrics
To identify flood- and tornado-based exposures to tropical cyclones in US counties, we used event listings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Storm Event Database (NOAA NCEI 2017). For each tropical cyclone, we identified all events with event types related to flooding ("Flood", "Flash Flood", "Coastal Flood") and tornadoes ("Tornado") and

that occurred in a county within 500 km of the tropical cyclone's track and with a start date within a five-day window centered on the date of the tropical cyclone's closest approach to the county (Anderson, Schumacher, W. Crosson, et al. 2017). "Flood", "Flash Flood" and "Tornado" events in this database were reported by county Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code. "Coastal Flood" events were reported by forecast zone; for these, the event was matched to the appropriate county if possible (Anderson and Z. Chen 2017). While this database has recorded storm data since 1950, its coverage changed substantially in 1996 to cover a wider variety of storm events (NOAA NCEI 2017). We therefore only considered these metrics of hurricane exposure for tropical cyclones in 1996 and later. As validation for the flood data, we compared streamflow data from US Geological Survey gages (USGS 2016; Lammers and Anderson 2017; Hirsch and De Cicco 2015) in nine counties with tropical cyclone flood classifications based on the NOAA Storm Events Database (Figure 7).

Assessing agreement in exposure classification between metrics
Two of the exposure metrics (flood- and tornado-based) were inherently binary, since these metrics were based on whether an event was listed in the NOAA Storm Events database or not. For the other exposure metrics, each county was classified as exposed to a tropical cyclone based on whether the exposure metric exceeded a certain threshold (Table 1). We assessed county-level tropical cyclone exposure in the eastern US based on each exposure metric for all land-falling or near-land Atlantic basin tropical cyclones. Depending on available exposure data, this assessment included some or all of the period from 1988 to 2015, a period with 136 tropical cyclones that made US landfall or passed within 250 km (155 mi) of at least one US county (Figure S2). We measured agreement between exposure metrics in the classification of a county as exposed or unexposed to a specific tropical cyclone. For this measurement, we calculated the within-storm Jaccard index (Jaccard 1901; Jaccard 1908) between every pair-wise combination of hazard metrics. The Jaccard index (Js ) measures similarity between two metrics (X1,s and X2,s ) for tropical cyclone s as the proportion of counties in which both of the metrics classify the county as exposed out of all counties classified as exposed by at least one of the metrics: Js = X1,s  X2,s X1,s  X2,s (1)

This metric can range from 0, in the case of no overlap between the counties classified as exposed based on the two metrics, to 1, in the case that the two metrics classify exactly the same counties as exposed to the tropical cyclone.

Case study: Physical exposure of electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries to tropical cyclones
The outcomes of disasters depend both on the geophysical forces of the disaster as well as on the vulnerability of the society living in the geographical areas affected by those forces. (Chakraborty, Tobin, and Montz 2005; Anderson-Berry 2003; Cutter 1996) As a case study of how differences in tropical cyclone exposure assessments across different hazard metrics influence estimates of physical exposures of susceptible populations to tropical cyclones, we investigated how the use of different metrics influenced estimates of which eastern US counties have the highest expected average exposures of electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries to tropical cyclones. This subpopulation was selected for this analysis since it may be particularly susceptible to health impacts from tropical cyclone exposure, especially through the pathway of storm-associated power outages and evacuations. We collected data on the number of electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries in each study county from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Service's emPower Map 2.0 (US HHS 2016). We then calculated the physical exposure of the

electricity-dependent Medicare population in each county, based on tropical cyclone assessments using each hazard metric, following (Peduzzi et al. 2009): Ec = Fc  Pc (2)

where Ec is the average yearly physical exposure among electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries in county c to tropical cyclone exposures based on a given metric, Fc is the estimated yearly expected frequency of tropical cyclone exposures in county c based on that metric, and Pc is the size of the electricity-dependent Medicare population in county c, as of July 2017. When combined with estimates of vulnerability of a population to a natural hazard, such measurements of physical exposure can be used to calculate risk of human losses from the hazard (Peduzzi et al. 2009).

counties

We first calculated summary statistics for the exposure assessments (Table 2). There was wide variation in the average number of county exposures per year under the five different tropical cyclone metrics considered. For the tornado metric, there were approximately 50 county exposures identified per year, on average, within our study. For flood and wind metrics, there were substantially more county exposures identified (>200 per year on average), and even more when assessing exposure using the distance and rain metrics (>400 per year on average). We also measured the average number of county exposures per tropical cyclone, within those tropical cyclones in which at least one county was exposed to the hazard (Table 2). The typical number of county exposures per tropical cyclone was lowest when assessing exposure using the tornado metric (median: 7 county exposures per tropical cyclone), higher under the flood and wind metrics (median: 26 and 34, respectively), and even higher for the metrics of rain (median: 68) and distance (median: 84). For every metric except the tornado-based metric, we identified at least one tropical cyclone with over 300 counties exposed. However, the largest-extent tropical cyclone varied by metric (e.g., Beryl in 1994 exposed the most counties based on distance, Frances in 2004 based on rain, and Ike in 2008 based on wind).

Agreement in county-specific exposure classification to specific tropical cyclones
The counties that were identified as exposed to a tropical cyclone differed substantially depending on which metric was used in exposure assessment. This was true both when comparing exposure assessment based on distance versus the four hazard-specific metrics considered (wind, rain, floods, and tornadoes) and also when comparing exposure assessments among the four hazardspecific metrics. Figure 1 gives an example of how sensitive county-level tropical cyclone exposure assessment is to the choice of metric, using as an example Hurricane Ivan in 2004, which was recordbreaking for its duration as a major hurricane (James L Franklin et al. 2006). When county-level exposure was determined based on distance, the counties assessed as exposed followed the tropical cyclone's track, including counties well inland. For the wind metric, only counties near two of the tropical cyclone's landfalls were assessed as exposed. For rain- and flood-based metrics, however, exposure extended to the left of the track, including counties as far north as New York and Connecticut, while for the tornado metric, exposed counties tended to be to the right of the track and included several counties in central North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia that were not identified as exposed to Ivan based on any other metric. Figure S3provides similar maps for four other example tropical cyclones (selected because they exposed many US counties based on at least one metric), and Figure S4provides four examples of tropical cyclones in which

the disagreement in exposure assessment between rain- and wind-based metrics was particularly notable. We drew similar conclusions when we investigated all 46 tropical cyclones between 1996 and 2011 (the period for which all five metrics were available) for which 250 or more counties were exposed based on at least one metric (Figure 2). In this figure, each row provides results for a specific tropical cyclone, and each box in that row shows a measure of agreement between a specific pair of metrics in terms of the counties assessed as exposed to that tropical cyclone, with darker colors representing greater agreement in county-level exposure assessments. For most tropical cyclone, distance-based county-level exposure assessment was at best in moderate agreement with exposure assessments based on the four hazard-based metrics. For almost all tropical cyclones, Jaccard index values between distance and any of the four hazardbased metrics were 0.6 or lower (i.e., out of the counties assessed as exposed to the tropical cyclone by at least one of the two metrics considered, 60% or fewer of the counties had the same exposure assessment under the two metrics). For many tropical cyclones, the Jaccard index values were 0.2 or lower, suggesting very poor agreement in exposure assessment between the metrics. Among the four hazard-based metrics, the tornado-based metric showed universally poor agreement with other metrics in county-level classification across all tropical cyclones considered. For other pairs of metrics, there were also generally large differences in which counties were determined to be exposed to the tropical cyclone, with the Jaccard index values below 0.4 for most metric pairs in most tropical cyclones. There were, however, a few exceptions -- tropical cyclones in which similar counties were determined to be exposed to the tropical cyclone for two or more of the metrics considered. For Floyd in 1999 (Figure S3) and Irene in 2011, for example, county-level classification agreed moderately to well (Jaccard index of approximately 0.5 ­ 0.8) for all pairs of exposure metrics except those including the tornado-based metric. These tropical cyclones both made their first US landfall in North Carolina at minor hurricane windspeeds (Category 2 and 1, respectively) and then skimmed the eastern coast of the US north through New England, bringing large rainfall to much of the eastern coast from North Carolina north and causing extensive inland flooding in North Carolina (Floyd) and New England (Irene) (Avila and Stewart 2013; Lawrence et al. 2000). For another set of tropical cyclones (e.g., Lee in 2011 [Figure S3], Ernesto in 2006, and Bertha in 1996), there was moderate to good agreement for all pairwise combinations of distance, rain, and wind, but poor agreement for all other combinations of metrics. Most of these tropical cyclones either followed the eastern coastline north of North Carolina (Bertha in 1996, Charley in 2004, Gaston in 2004, Barry in 2007, and Hanna in 2008), in a pattern similar to Hurricanes Floyd in 1999 and Irene in 2011, or made landfall in or near the Florida panhandle and cut across to exit into the Atlantic around North Carolina (Josephine in 1996, Earl in 1998, Alberto in 2006). However, these two sets of tropical cyclones represented the minority of all tropical cyclones considered; for most tropical cyclones, there was low overlap in the counties determined to be exposed to the tropical cyclones between most pairings of metrics.

Geographic patterns in tropical cyclone exposures
When the average number of exposures per decade in each county were calculated, strong geographical patterns were clear across tropical cyclone exposure assessments based on these different metrics (Figure 3). Wind-based exposure had a strong coastal pattern, with almost all exposures in counties within about 200 km (124 mi) of the coastline. While exposures by rain- and distance-based metrics were also more common in coastal areas compared to inland areas, inland exposures were much more common based on these two metrics compared to the wind-based metric. Rain and, to some extent, flood exposures were characterized by a pattern defined by the Appalachian Mountains, with much lower exposures west of the mountain range than to the east. Almost all tornado-based exposures were in coastal states, with most in Florida,

Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina and almost none north of Maryland. Flood-based exposures were highest in North Carolina and along the South Carolina coast, as well as further north in New Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southeastern New York. Notably, some areas of the US that experienced regular exposures to tropical cyclone-related excessive rainfall and floods were not identified as areas of regular risk based on the more commonly used tropical cyclone exposure assessment metrics of wind or distance (Figure 3). We conducted a case study to investigate how these differences in exposure assessment across the five metrics considered could strongly influence health-related studies based on physical exposure to tropical cyclones. For this example, we compared estimates of which US counties have the largest expected physical exposure to tropical cyclones among a susceptible subpopulation, Medicare beneficiaries who are reliant on electricity for medical equipment (Figure S6) (US HHS 2016). We found that a few counties (Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX) were ranked in the top three counties of physical exposure among electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries for almost all exposure metrics (Figure 4). However, there were key differences when using different exposure metrics. For example, Florida counties dominated the lists of top exposed counties based on wind- and tornado-based metrics, while over half of the counties for the flood-based metric were in Mid-Atlantic states (PA, NY).

Software
To assist with future tropical cyclone impact studies, we created and published open source software that includes the hazard-specific, county-level tropical cyclone data in this paper, as well as tools to explore and map that data (Anderson, Yan, et al. 2017; Anderson, Schumacher, W. Crosson, et al. 2017). This software includes continuous data for the distance-, rain-, and wind-based metrics, allowing users to also explore different thresholds of these metrics when assessing exposure. We investigated how well these data correspond with data from other available sources (Figures S7 ­ 11). Within the nine sample counties, storm-related rainfall from the reanalysis precipitation dataset was well-correlated with station-based rainfall measurements, although the reanalysis data did tend to somewhat underestimate rainfall totals in storms with extremely high rainfall (Figure 6). A distance constraint (county population mean center within 500 km of the storm's closest approach) was necessary for assessing storm exposure based on this metric to ensure that rains unrelated and far from the storm track were not misattributed to storm exposures. We found that this distance constraint was typically adequately large to capture storm-related rain, although in rare examples of exceptionally large storms (e.g., Hurricane Ike in 2008) or storms for which tracking was stopped at extratropical transition (e.g., Tropical Storm Lee in 2011), some storm-related rains were missed because of this distance constraint (Figure ??). The modeled wind speeds generally agreed well with the HURDAT 2 wind radii (Figure 5), with disagreement mostly limited to large storms that were characterized by high winds well inland (e.g., Hurricanes Ike in 2008 and Sandy in 2012; Figure ??). Stream gage data generally indicated higher discharge in these counties on dates identified as flood events, particularly in counties with more reporting stream gages (e.g., Harris County, TX, with 10 reporting stream gages; Figure 7), although these two flooding data sources were not completely consistent. While generally in agreement with data from other sources, there are a few limitations. The wind data are based on modeled, rather than observed, values, and while the modeled wind data generally agree well with post-analysis maximum wind radii from the revised Atlantic hurricane database HURDAT 2 (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013) (Figure S7), for a few tropical cyclones it did not (e.g., Figure S10). The rainfall data are from re-analysis data, which are generally well-correlated with observed ground-based station data but sometimes oversmooth extreme measurements (Figure S8).

Discussion
Tropical cyclones impact public health in many ways, and epidemiological studies of the health risk and impacts associated with tropical cyclone exposures could help improve preparedness for and response to future tropical cyclones. However, tropical cyclones are multi-hazard events, making it more complicated to measure exposure compared to other weather exposures like temperature and precipitation. Here, we find the county-level tropical cyclone exposure assessments vary substantially when using a distance-based metric versus four hazard-based metrics, as well as among different hazard-based metrics. Our results can inform exposure assessment for future county-level studies of the health risks and impacts associated with tropical cyclones exposures, and the data and software we have created to accompany this article provides multi-hazard, county-level exposure data for multiple tropical cyclone hazards for such studies. Distance from a tropical cyclone's track is relatively easy to measure and has been used as an operational metric of exposure to tropical cyclones in previous large-scale studies (examples include ...). Since distance itself does not constitute a hazard, distance is meant in these cases as a surrogate to capture exposure to hazards from the tropical cyclone. However, here we found that in assessing US county-level exposure to tropical cyclones, distance is, at best, a moderate, and often a very poor, surrogate for exposure to the specific tropical cyclone hazards of high wind, extreme rainfall, flooding, and tornadoes (Figure 2). Therefore, use of distance to assess tropical cyclone exposure for impact studies could result in problematic exposure misclassification, which could mask true associations, even strong associations, between tropical cyclone exposure and outcomes of interest in impact studies (Savitz and Wellenius 2016; Armstrong 1998). In some cases, this exposure misclassification may be differential (i.e., associated with the outcome of interest or with factors associated with risk of the outcome of interest). For example, tropical cyclone wind exposures tend to be concentrated in counties near the coast, since most tropical cyclones rapidly decrease in sustained windspeed following landfall. However, tropical cyclone exposures based on distance can extend well inland, following the tropical cyclone's tracks, but may not adequately capture all wind-exposed counties near the coast. In this case, if the etiologically-relevant exposure is high wind but exposure is classified based on distance, the probability of being misclassified as unexposed would be higher in coastal counties, while the probability of being misclassified as exposed would be higher in inland counties. If coastal counties differ from inland counties in either the outcome of interest or in factors associated with risk of that outcome, differential exposure misclassification would exist (Savitz and Wellenius 2016). Such differential exposure misclassification can bias estimates of tropical cyclone effects either towards the null (estimating a lower or null association compared to the true association that exists) or away from the null (estimating a larger association than actually exists) (Savitz and Wellenius 2016; Armstrong 1998). The use of a single hazard-based metric (e.g., wind) could cause similar problems if the impact is driven, at least in part, by a different hazard or by multiple hazards of the tropical cyclone. Our findings -- that county-level tropical cyclone exposure assessment varies substantially when different exposure measurements are considered -- aligns with previous research from atmospheric science and related fields on the characteristics of tropical cyclones. While tropical cyclone rainfall and windspeed are often well-correlated when the tropical cyclone is over water (Cerveny and Newman 2000), this relationship often does not remain as strong once the hurricane has made landfall (Jiang et al. 2008). Fast-moving tropical cyclones bring higher risks of dangerous winds inland (Kruk et al. 2010), while slow-moving tropical cyclone are likely to bring more rain (Rappaport 2000) and cause more damage because of sustained hazardous conditions (Rezapour and Baldock 2014). Further, while the likelihood and extent of flooding during a tropical cyclone is related to the tropical cyclone's rainfall, it is also driven by factors like top soil saturation and the structure of the water basin's drainage network (X. Chen, Kumar, and McGlynn 2015; Sturdevant­Rees et al. 2001). However, we did find a small set of tropical

cyclones for which for which agreement between metrics were unusually high (e.g., Floyd in 1999, Irene in 2011, Hannah in 2008, Bertha in 1996) For this set of tropical cyclones, the tropical cyclones' persistent proximity to water may have helped maintain wind speeds in similar patterns to rain and distance exposures, resulting in this moderate to good agreement among exposure assessments based on different metrics. In our results, wind-based exposure had a strong coastal pattern, with almost all exposures in counties within about 200 km (124 mi) of the coastline. This is consistent with the dramatic decrease in wind intensity that typically characterizes the landfall of tropical cyclones. Exposures by rain- and distance-based metrics often extended further inland compared to the wind-based metric, up to the Appalachian mountains. This agrees with previous research indicating that the Appalachian mountains' topography both enhances precipitation during tropical cyclones and provides hydrological conditions for severe flooding (Sturdevant­Rees et al. 2001). Almost all tornado-based exposures were in southern coastal states. This pattern echoes previous findings that most noteworthy tropical cyclone-related tornadoes occur on the right-side of the tropical cyclone track in Atlantic-basin US storms (Moore and Dixon 2012). The tropical cyclone exposure averages shown in Figure 3 are limited as estimates of longterm frequencies, as tropical cyclones follow decadal patterns (Kossin and Vimont 2007) likely not adequately captured in the available data. However, these frequency maps, together with evidence from specific tropical cyclones (Figures 1 and 2), do illustrate the potential for strong differences in spatial patterns in tropical cyclone exposures, depending on which tropical cyclone hazards are considered. A few previous studies have sought to determine county-level exposure to tropical cyclones over multi-year periods, including Zandbergen (2009), which estimated exposure in US counties to all US landfalling Atlantic-basin tropical cyclones between 1851 and 2003, using both a distance-based metric and a metric that combined distance and windspeed, and Kruk et al. (2010), which explored exposure to hurricane-related winds in the US, including inland areas, for 1900 ­ 2008. Our results suggest that such exposure assessments may perform well in capturing some tropical cyclone hazards (e.g., wind), but likely miss other potentially dangerous tropical cyclone exposures, especially for hazards that repeatedly threaten northern or inland counties (e.g., rain, flooding). Dissimilarity in exposure to specific hazards of tropical cyclones can result in differing patterns in estimates of county-level exposure (Figure 1), which can lead to substantial differences in estimates of population physical exposure (Figure 4), based on which storm hazard is considered. The measure of a hurricane's intensity, the Saffir-Simpson scale, expresses intensity as a function of wind speed, and so fails to capture potential risks from other hazards of the storm (Smith and Petley 2009), and previous assessments of physical exposure to tropical cyclones have often focused on winds or distance from the storm. For example, a global study of exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards used a combination of windspeed above a certain threshold and distance from the storm's track to assess exposure (Peduzzi et al. 2009). While many storm impacts might be most strongly linked to wind hazards, there is a growing recognition of the potential risks of adverse health outcomes and property damage from rain- and floodrelated tropical cyclone hazards in the US (Smith and Petley 2009). Such assessments may underemphasize potentially dangerous exposures to certain regions of the US, particularly inland locations. In fact, based on our assessment of physical exposures to tropical cyclones among electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries, the highest expected physical exposure under any metric was measured for Philadelphia County, PA, under the flood metric (Figure 4). While this county has a similar-sized population of electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries as Miami-Dade County, FL (Figure 4), the frequency of storm-related flood events in this inland county results in a very high expected physical exposure among this subpopulation, while this county is not included in the top ten counties for physical exposure based on most of the other exposure metrics.

Software
To assist with future tropical cyclone studies, we created and published open source software to accompany this article (Anderson, Schumacher, W. Crosson, et al. 2017; Anderson, Yan, et al. 2017). Many previous studies have used geographical information system software (e.g., ArcGIS) to assess exposure to tropical cyclones in the US (Grabich, Horney, et al. 2016; Zandbergen 2009; Czajkowski, Simmons, and Sutter 2011; Kruk et al. 2010). Here, we offer methods to map and output historic exposure to tropical cyclones that does not require the use of proprietary software but instead uses a package written in the R statistical programming language (R Core Team 2017), which is free and open-source. In addition to providing tropical cyclone exposure metrics for individual hazards, this software and data also allow users to create tropical cyclone exposure profiles based on multiple hazards or craft exposure indices that combine hazard metrics (Chakraborty, Tobin, and Montz 2005; Peduzzi et al. 2009). This ability can be critical, as different hazards of tropical cyclones often act synergistically in causing impacts (Smith and Petley 2009). Further, by including measurements of different hazard exposures in each county for each tropical cyclone, this software allows for the development of more complex exposure indices or models (e.g., random forests, multivariable generalized linear models) that incorporate multiple tropical cyclone hazard measurements. In creating this hurricane exposure dataset, we aimed for data that are reliable, available for all eastern US counties, and have no missing data within available dates. Further, we have investigated how well these data correspond with data from other available sources (Figures S7 ­ 11). While generally in agreement with data from other sources, there are a few limitations. The wind data are based on modeled, rather than observed, values, and while the modeled wind data generally agree well with post-analysis maximum wind radii from HURDAT 2 (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013) (Figure S7), for a few tropical cyclones it did not (e.g., Figure S10). The rainfall data are from re-analysis data, which are generally well-correlated with observed ground-based station data but sometimes oversmooth extreme measurements (Figure S8). The flood and tornado data came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events database, which, while a widely-used database of events maintained by NOAA, is based on reports, and so may be prone to underreporting (S. T. Ashley and W. S. Ashley 2008; Curran, Holle, and L´ opez 2000), especially in less populated areas (Witt et al. 1998; W. S. Ashley 2007), as well as to other reporting errors. While these are important limitations, we selected these data sources as among the best currently available for measuring each of these hazards at a multi-county, multi-year scale.

Conclusions
Previous research has highlighted the range of impacts that tropical cyclones can have in US communities. However, studies have varied widely in how they assess exposure to tropical cyclones for exposure, health impact, and other impact studies, in some cases using distance to the tropical cyclone's track as a surrogate metric of exposure to a tropical cyclone's hazards. Here we found large differences in which counties are exposed to different hazards of tropical cyclones and that distance is, at best, a moderate, and often a very poor, surrogate for exposure to the specific tropical cyclone hazards of high wind, extreme rainfall, flooding, and tornadoes. Use of distance as a surrogate for any of these hazards could lead to exposure misclassification and, in the case of tropical cyclone risk and impact studies, including epidemiological studies, result in biased estimates. Similarly, if such studies disagree on their findings, it could result from the often poor agreement between exposure classifications based on these different metrics, making studies that use different metrics hard to compare or combine in meta-analyses. Our findings highlight the importance of clarifying the potential pathway from tropical cyclone hazards to health impacts when conducting tropical cyclone epidemiological studies and basing exposure assessment on measurements of these hazards. To help with this, we provide extensive tropical

cyclone hazard-related measurements for a large collection of historical Atlantic-basin cyclones, aggregated at the county level to align with the spatial scale at which much health-related data is collected.

A county exposure represents the exposure of a specific eastern US county to a specific tropical cyclone. A county can be exposed to multiple tropical cyclones within a year, and a tropical cyclone can create multiple county exposures under a given metric. The median and interquartile range of county exposures per tropical cyclone is based on the tropical cyclones for which at least one US county was exposed.

. Heatmap of Jaccard index values for specific exposure metric pairs within storms. Only storms between 1996 and 2011, and for which at least 250 counties were exposed based on at least one metric, are included. The color of each cell within the main heatmap indicates the value of the Jaccard index (proportion of counties classified as exposed by both metrics out of storms classified as exposed by either metric) for a given pair of metrics for a given storm. Storms are displayed within clusters that have similar patterns in county-level exposure agreement for metric pairs, based on hierarchical clustering using the complete link method (Murtagh and Contreras 2012) (i.e., storms in the same cluster tend to have similar patterns for the pairwise strength of agreement among metrics); columns are also ordered based on hierarchical clustering. The colors to the right of the main heatmap for each storm indicate the total number of counties classified as exposed to the storm by any of the five metrics, providing an estimate of storm extent. Maps are available showing the counties identified as exposed under each of five metrics for the widest-extent storm in each cluster: Hurricane Ivan (2004) (Figure 1) and Hurricanes Floyd (1999), Lee (2011), Cindy (2005), and Katrina (2005) (Figure S3

Comparison of estimated wind categories from modeled sustained wind speed (as used for the wind exposure metric in the main text; (Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017)) versus sustained wind speed determined from HURDAT 2 (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013). In HURDAT 2, wind radii were available for study storms from 2004 ­ 2015 and gives estimates of the maximum radii to which storm winds of 34 kn, 50 kn, and 64 kn extended in each four quadrant of the storm at each of the 6-h storm track observations. We interpolated this data to 15-min increments and assessed a county as exposed to winds at or above one of these cutoffs if its population mean center was within 85% of the maximum radius for that wind speed in its quadrant of the storm. For each county in each of the available storms, we also calculated the modeled wind speed (Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017) and then categorized this value into the same categories available for the HURDAT 2 wind radii (<34 kn; 34 ­ 49.9 kn; 50 ­ 63.9 kn; 64 kn). Each point in this graph shows, for a storm, the percent of counties in which the wind category (<34 kn; 34 ­ 49.9 kn; 50 ­ 63.9 kn; 64 kn) was the same based on both modeled winds and the HURDAT 2 wind radii. Only storms with at least one county with sustained wind of 34 kn, based on the HURDAT 2 wind radii, are shown. Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Ike (2008) were he two storms with the worst agreement between these two sets of wind data; maps with further comparisons between the two data sources for these two storms are given in Figure ??

Comparison of county-level rain exposure based on the reanalysis data used for exposure assessment in this study NLDAS -2 (Rui and Mocko 2014; Al-Hamdan et al. 2014) and ground-based weather stations (Menne et al. 2012; Chamberlain 2017; Severson and Anderson 2016). Each small graph shows a sample county, and each point on the graph represents a tropical storm that came within 500 km of the population mean center of the county. The x-axis shows the estimated cumulative rainfall (in millimeters) from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach to the county based on the county-aggregated NLDAS -2 recipitation data used to measure rain exposure in our main analysis. The ground-based observations (y-axis) are based on collecting precipitation data from available weather stations in the county, 1988 ­ 2011, summed over the same period from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach for each available station. These cumulative station-based precipitation totals were then averaged across all available stations in the county to create a county-wide estimate of cumulative storm-related precipitation for each storm in the county. Horizontal and vertical lines show the threshold used to classify a storm as exposed based on cumulative rainfall; storms in the lower left and upper right quadrants are classified the same regardless of whether reanalysis or station-based precipitation data is considered, while storms in the upper left and lower right quadrants would be classified differently. The number of storms within each county and the average number of stations reporting rainfall during the county's storms are given above each plot. Note that x- and y-axis ranges differ by county. An estimate of the rank correlation (Spearman's  (Spearman 1904)) between measurements from the two rain data sources is also shown on each graph.

Comparison of for a sample of study counties of flood status, based on NOAA Storm Events listings (NOAA NCEI 2017; Anderson and Z. Chen 2017), with total streamflows at county streamflow gages during tropical storms (USGS 2016; Lammers and Anderson 2017; Hirsch and De Cicco 2015). Each panel represents a separate county. For each county, we first identified all streamflow gages in the county that had complete data for Jan. 1 1996 ­ Dec. 31, 2015. The number of streamflow gages meeting this criterion are given in parentheses beside the county's name in the panel title. This analysis covered tropical storm that came within 500 km of each sample county between 1996 and 2015. In the graphs, each point represents a single tropical storm, and the point's position along the x-axis shows the highest daily total streamflow (cubic feet / second), summed across all identified streamgages in the county, for a five-day window centered on the day of the storm's closest approach to the county. The y-axis separates storms for which a flood event was reported in NOAA's Storm Events database for the county with a start date within the five-day window of the storm's closest approach to the county (NOAA NCEI 2017; Anderson and Z. Chen 2017). Boxplots are added to show the distribution of the total streamflow measurements across storms in the county for storms grouped by whether or not they were linked with a flood event based on the NOAA Storm Events data. The color of each point gives the percent of streamflow gages in the county with a daily streamflow that exceeded a threshold of flooding (the streamgage's median value for annual peak flow (Lammers and Anderson 2017)) on any day during the five-day window. Note that the x-axis scales differ by county, depending on the number of streamflow gages and typical flow rates for each gage, and are on a log-10 scale.

Figure 2: Heatmap of Jaccard index values for specific exposure metric pairs within storms. Only storms between 1996 and 2011, and for which at least 250 counties were exposed based on at least one metric, are included. The color of each cell within the main heatmap indicates the value of the Jaccard index (proportion of counties classified as exposed by both metrics out of storms classified as exposed by either metric) for a given pair of metrics for a given storm. Storms are displayed within clusters that have similar patterns in county-level exposure agreement for metric pairs, based on hierarchical clustering using the complete link method (Murtagh and Contreras 2012) (i.e., storms in the same cluster tend to have similar patterns for the pairwise strength of agreement among metrics); columns are also ordered based on hierarchical clustering. The colors to the right of the main heatmap for each storm indicate the total number of counties classified as exposed to the storm by any of the five metrics, providing an estimate of storm extent. Maps are available showing the counties identified as exposed under each of five metrics for the widest-extent storm in each cluster: Hurricane Ivan (2004) (Figure 1) and Hurricanes Floyd (1999), Lee (2011), Cindy (2005), and Katrina (2005) (Figure S3

Figure 5: Comparison of estimated wind categories from modeled sustained wind speed (as used for the wind exposure metric in the main text; (Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017)) versus sustained wind speed determined from HURDAT 2 (Landsea and James L. Franklin 2013). In HURDAT 2, wind radii were available for study storms from 2004 ­ 2015 and gives estimates of the maximum radii to which storm winds of 34 kn, 50 kn, and 64 kn extended in each four quadrant of the storm at each of the 6-h storm track observations. We interpolated this data to 15-min increments and assessed a county as exposed to winds at or above one of these cutoffs if its population mean center was within 85% of the maximum radius for that wind speed in its quadrant of the storm. For each county in each of the available storms, we also calculated the modeled wind speed (Anderson, Schumacher, Guikema, et al. 2017) and then categorized this value into the same categories available for the HURDAT 2 wind radii (<34 kn; 34 ­ 49.9 kn; 50 ­ 63.9 kn; 64 kn). Each point in this graph shows, for a storm, the percent of counties in which the wind category (<34 kn; 34 ­ 49.9 kn; 50 ­ 63.9 kn; 64 kn) was the same based on both modeled winds and the HURDAT 2 wind radii. Only storms with at least one county with sustained wind of 34 kn, based on the HURDAT 2 wind radii, are shown. Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Ike (2008) were he two storms with the worst agreement between these two sets of wind data; maps with further comparisons between the two data sources for these two storms are given in Figure ??

Figure 7: Comparison of for a sample of study counties of flood status, based on NOAA Storm Events listings (NOAA NCEI 2017; Anderson and Z. Chen 2017), with total streamflows at county streamflow gages during tropical storms (USGS 2016; Lammers and Anderson 2017; Hirsch and De Cicco 2015). Each panel represents a separate county. For each county, we first identified all streamflow gages in the county that had complete data for Jan. 1 1996 ­ Dec. 31, 2015. The number of streamflow gages meeting this criterion are given in parentheses beside the county's name in the panel title. This analysis covered tropical storm that came within 500 km of each sample county between 1996 and 2015. In the graphs, each point represents a single tropical storm, and the point's position along the x-axis shows the highest daily total streamflow (cubic feet / second), summed across all identified streamgages in the county, for a five-day window centered on the day of the storm's closest approach to the county. The y-axis separates storms for which a flood event was reported in NOAA's Storm Events database for the county with a start date within the five-day window of the storm's closest approach to the county (NOAA NCEI 2017; Anderson and Z.

Boxplots are added to show the distribution of the total streamflow measurements across storms in the county for storms grouped by whether or not they were linked with a flood event based on the NOAA Storm Events data. The color of each point gives the percent of streamflow gages in the county with a daily streamflow that exceeded a threshold of flooding (the streamgage's median value for annual peak flow (Lammers and Anderson 2017)) on any day during the five-day window. Note that the x-axis scales differ by county, depending on the number of streamflow gages and typical flow rates for each gage, and are on a log-10 scale.
