\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S1}{\ignorespaces Metrics used in a sample of previous studies to assign exposure to tropical cyclones in U.S.-based tropical cyclone exposure or impact studies. Citations for each study are shown on the left and the broad topic of the study on the left. Presence of a bar for a study-metric combination indicates that the given metric was used in the study in assessing exposure to tropical cyclones for that study, either alone or in combination with other metrics for which that study has bars. The color transparency of each bar indicates the number of different thresholds considered for defining storm exposure in the study under that hazard (e.g., less transparent bars indicate that a study considered multiple thresholds of the metric in defining tropical cyclone exposure as a method of sensitivity analysis). Studies for which there are two or more bars (e.g., bars for both distance and wind) indicate studies that either used separate exposure assessments, one for each metric, (e.g., as a sensitivity analysis) or used a single exposure index that incorporated multiple metrics in its definition. ``Damage" often indicate use of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reports, although occassionally used damage reports from other sources, including newspaper reports. Examples of ``Other" include evacuation orders, excessive school closures, length of time a storm was near a location, and detailed, holistic analyses of a specific storm or storms. References for each study are included in the bibliography of this Supplemental Material.}}{7}{figure.1}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S4}{\ignorespaces Examples of storms for which storm extent, as measured by the number of counties exposed, differed substantially between rain-based and wind-based metrics. Counties shown in orange were classified as exposed to a given storm by a given metric; those in yellow were classified as not exposed. The storm's track is shown in red. For both Frances (2004) and Isidore (2002) (top panel), storm extent was much larger when measuring exposure based on rain rather than wind. Conversely, for both Hugo (1989) and Isabel (2003) (bottom panel), storm extent was large when exposure was measured based on wind compared to rain.}}{10}{figure.4}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S6}{\ignorespaces Comparison of estimated wind categories from modeled sustained wind speed (as used for the wind exposure metric in the main text; \citep {stormwindmodel}) versus sustained wind speed determined from the revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT2 \citep {landsea2013}). In HURDAT2, wind radii were available for study storms from 2004--2015 and gives estimates of the maximum radii to which storm winds of 34 knots, 50 knots, and 64 knots extended in each four quadrant of the storm at each of the six-hour storm track observations. We interpolated this data to 15-minute increments and assessed a county as exposed to winds at or above one of these cutoffs if its population mean center was within 85\% of the maximum radius for that wind speed in its quadrant of the storm. For each county in each of the available storms, we also calculated the modeled wind speed \citep {stormwindmodel} and then categorized this value into the same categories available for the HURDAT2 wind radii ($<$34 knots; 34--49.9 knots; 50--63.9 knots; $\ge $64 knots). Each point in this graph shows, for a storm, the percent of counties in which the wind category ($<$34 knots; 34--49.9 knots; 50--63.9 knots; $\ge $64 knots) was the same based on both modeled winds and the HURDAT2 wind radii. Only storms with at least one county with sustained wind of $\ge $34 knots, based on the HURDAT2 wind radii, are shown. Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Ike (2008) were he two storms with the worst agreement between these two sets of wind data; maps with further comparisons between the two data sources for these two storms are given in Fig. \ref {fig:windexamples}.}}{12}{figure.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S7}{\ignorespaces Comparison of county-level rain exposure based on the reanalysis data used for exposure assessment in this study (NLDAS-2) \citep {rui2013nldas, alhamdan2014environmental} and ground-based weather stations \citep {menne2012overview, rnoaa, countyweather}. Each small graph shows a sample county, and each point on the graph represents a tropical storm that came within 500 kilometers of the population mean center of the county. The x-axis shows the estimated cumulative rainfall (in millimeters) from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach to the county based on the county-aggregated NLDAS-2 precipitation data used to measure rain exposure in our main analysis. The ground-based observations (y-axis) are based on collecting precipitation data from available weather stations in the county, 1988--2011, summed over the same period from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach for each available station. These cumulative station-based precipitation totals were then averaged across all available stations in the county to create a county-wide estimate of cumulative storm-related precipitation for each storm in the county. Horizontal and vertical lines show the threshold used to classify a storm as exposed based on cumulative rainfall; storms in the lower left and upper right quadrants are classified the same regardless of whether reanalysis or station-based precipitation data is considered, while storms in the upper left and lower right quadrants would be classified differently. The number of storms within each county and the average number of stations reporting rainfall during the county's storms are given above each plot. Note that x- and y-axis ranges differ by county. An estimate of the rank correlation (Spearman's $\rho $ \citep {spearman1904proof}) between measurements from the two rain data sources is also shown on each graph.}}{13}{figure.7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S8}{\ignorespaces Comparison of for a sample of study counties of flood status, based on NOAA Storm Events listings \citep {stormevents, noaastormevents}, with total streamflows at county streamflow gages during tropical storms \citep {usgsgages, countyfloods, dataRetrieval}. Each panel represents a separate county. For each county, we first identified all streamflow gages in the county that had complete data for Jan. 1 1996--Dec. 31, 2015. The number of streamflow gages meeting this criterion are given in parentheses beside the county's name in the panel title. This analysis covered tropical storm that came within 500 kilometers of each sample county between 1996 and 2015. In the graphs, each point represents a single tropical storm, and the point's position along the x-axis shows the highest daily total streamflow (cubic feet / second), summed across all identified streamgages in the county, for a five-day window centered on the day of the storm's closest approach to the county. The y-axis separates storms for which a flood event was reported in NOAA's Storm Events database for the county with a start date within the five-day window of the storm's closest approach to the county \citep {stormevents, noaastormevents}. Boxplots are added to show the distribution of the total streamflow measurements across storms in the county for storms grouped by whether or not they were linked with a flood event based on the NOAA Storm Events data. The color of each point gives the percent of streamflow gages in the county with a daily streamflow that exceeded a threshold of flooding (the streamgage's median value for annual peak flow \citep {countyfloods}) on any day during the five-day window. Note that the x-axis scales differ by county, depending on the number of streamflow gages and typical flow rates for each gage, and are on a log-10 scale.}}{14}{figure.8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S9}{\ignorespaces Wind classifications for the two storms, Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Ike (2008) for which exposure classifications from modeled wind data \citep {stormwindmodel} and HURDAT2 wind radii \citep {demuth2006improvement} showed the highest disagreement for storms between 2004 and 2015 (Fig. \ref {fig:windcomparison}). The top two maps show modeled (left) and HURDAT2 (right) windspeed categorizations for Hurricane Ike (2008), while the bottom two maps show the same windspeed characterizations for Hurricane Sandy (2012). In both cases, the storms were exceptionally large systems for which high winds persisted well inland from landfall and for which, based on the HURDAT2 data, a large number of counties were exposed to winds of $\ge $34 knots (Figure \ref {fig:windcomparison}).}}{15}{figure.9}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S10}{\ignorespaces Examples of storms where the rain exposure classification method fails to capture full storm-related rainfall because of the distance constraint used in that assessment metric. The red line on each map shows the track of the storm, based on the revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT2 \citep {landsea2013}). The color of each county in the map gives the cumulative precipitation (in millimeters) for that county during the window from two days before to one day after the storm's closest approach to the county. The blue outline identifies the collection of counties that were classified as ``exposed" based on the criteria that the storm passed within 500 kilometers of the county's population mean center and the cumulative rainfall was 75 millimeters or more (Table 1 of main text). The map on the left shows rain-based exposure for Hurricane Ike. For this exceptionally large storm, there are some counties in northern Texas that received high rainfall from the storm but are too far from the storm center's track to be classified as exposed by this metric. The map on the right shows rain-based exposure for Tropical Storm Lee. For this storm, rain from the storm affected counties in the Mid-Atlantic and New England as the remnants of the storm moved over those regions, but storm tracking stopped while the storm was still over the southeastern part of the U.S., and so these counties are not classified as exposed to the storm based on this metric.}}{16}{figure.10}

The color of each bar indicates the number of Medicare beneficiaries in the county reliant on electricity-dependent medical and assistive equipment as of July 2017 \citep {empower}. The length of each bar shows the average expected number of these electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries exposed to tropical storms per year based on a given exposure metric.}}{17}{figure.11}
