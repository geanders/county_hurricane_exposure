\subsection*{Exposure assessment data, data validation, and software}

We created and published this tropical cyclone exposure data as an open-source
dataset, so they can be used by epidemiological
researchers~\parencite{hurricaneexposuredata}. These data include continuous
county-level measurements for the closest distance of each storm, cumulative
rainfall, and maximum sustained surface wind speed. These continuous metrics
can be used for classifying counties as exposed or unexposed, using thresholds
selected by the user, or can be used as continuous metrics. The dataset also
include binary data on flood and tornado events associated with each storm in
each county. To accompany these data, we published software tools to explore
and map the data and to integrate it with human health
datasets~\parencite{hurricaneexposure}. 

We explored potential limitations in these data by comparing them with data
from other available sources.  For estimates of storm-associated rainfall, we
compared estimates from NLDAS-2 re-analysis precipitation data (used as the
rainfall estimates in the open-source data) with ground-based observations in
nine sample counties (Figure~\ref{fig:raincomparison}). Within these counties,
storm-related rainfall measurements were well-correlated between the two data
sources, with rank correlations (bottom right of each graph in
Figure~\ref{fig:raincomparison}) between 0.87 and 0.98. There was some evidence
that the reanalysis data may tend to underestimate rainfall totals in storms
with extremely high rainfall, based on a few heavy-rainfall storms in Harris
County, TX, Mobile County, AL, Charleston County, SC, and Wake County, NC
(Figure~\ref{fig:raincomparison}). However, even in these cases, it was rare
for a storm to be classified differently (under the precipitation threshold
of 75~\si{\milli\metre} we used for binary exposure classification for later
analysis) based on the source of precipitation data---horizontal and vertical
lines in each small plot in Figure~\ref{fig:raincomparison} show the threshold
of 75~\si{\milli\metre}, so storms in the lower left and upper right quadrants
would be classified the same (``exposed'' or ``unexposed'') regardless of the
precipitation data source, while storms in the upper left and lower right
quadrants would be classified differently. Such cases are rare.

For maximum sustained surface wind estimates, we found that the modeled
estimates, which we included as the primary wind exposure metric in the open
source data and used for further analysis in this study, generally agreed well
with estimates based on the wind radii reported in \ac{HURDAT2}. For most
storms, $\ge$95\% of counties were assigned the same category of wind speed
($<$34~\si{\knot}; 34\,--\,49.9~\si{\knot}; 50\,--\,63.9~\si{\knot};
$\ge$64~\si{\knot}) by both data sources (Figure~\ref{fig:windcomparison}).
Disagreement was limited to large storms that were characterized by high winds
well inland, like Hurricanes Sandy in 2012 and Ike in 2008. For these two
storms, the modeled wind speed values somewhat overestimated the extent of the
storm's most severe winds at landfall but then underestimated the extent of
34\,--\,49.9 \si{\knot} storm winds further inland (Figure~S2). For
epidemiology researchers who would like to conduct sensitivity analysis
between these two sets of wind data, we have included estimates from the
\ac{HURDAT2} wind radii as a secondary measure of wind speeds in the
open-source dataset \parencite{hurricaneexposuredata}.

For flood data, we compared flood status, based on event listings in the NOAA
Storm Events database and included in the open-source data, to streamflow
measurements at \ac{US} Geological Survey gages within nine sample counties
(Figure~\ref{fig:floodcomparison}). Across the sampled counties, streamgage
data generally indicated higher discharge during periods identified as flood
events based on the NOAA Storm Events database, particularly in counties with
more reporting streamgages (e.g., Harris County, TX, with~10 reporting stream
gages; Figure~\ref{fig:floodcomparison}). There were some cases, however, where
the two flooding data sources were somewhat inconsistent.  For example, there
were one or two tropical cyclones in several of the counties (Mobile County,
AL, Escambia County, FL, and Montgomery County, PA) with associated flood event
listings but for which the total discharge across county streamflow gages was
below the 25\textsuperscript{th} percentile of measurements during storms
without a flood event listing in that county. For storms without a flood
listing for the county, in most cases the total streamflow discharge in
the county was lower than during storms for which there were flood
event listings. Further, in all but one of these cases, all streamgage flows
were below the flooding threshold. The exception was one storm in Fulton
County, GA (Hurricane Ida in 2009). 

\subsection*{Patterns in tropical cyclone exposures}

We used this storm exposure data to classify counties as exposed or unexposed
to four different hazards for each tropical cyclone and then explored patterns
over years with available data. Across the four storm hazards considered,
there was wide variation in the average number of county exposures per year
(Table~\ref{tab:exposuresummaries}). For the tropical cyclone tornado exposure,
there were on average about 50 county exposures per year within our study. For
tropical cyclone flood and wind exposures, county exposures were much more
frequent ($>$200 / yr on average), and even more when assessing tropical
cyclone rain exposure ($>$400 / yr on average). 

We also measured the average number of counties exposed per storm to each
hazard (limiting this analysis to the tropical cyclones that exposed at least
one county to that hazard; Table~\ref{tab:exposuresummaries}).  Tropical
cyclones typically exposed only a few counties, if any, to tornadoes (median
counties exposed per storm:~7), more counties to flooding and high winds
(median:~26 and~34, respectively), and even more counties to extreme rain
(median:~68).  For every hazard except tropical cyclone tornadoes, we
identified at least one tropical cyclone that exposed over~300 counties.
However, the largest-extent tropical cyclone varied across hazards: Frances
in~2004 exposed the most counties based on rain, Ike in~2008 based on wind, and
Ivan in 2004 based on flooding and tornadoes
(Table~\ref{tab:exposuresummaries}).

When we calculated and mapped the average number of exposures per decade in
each county for single-hazard exposures (Figure~\ref{fig:averageexposure}),
strong geographical patterns were clear. Tropical cyclone wind exposure had a
strong coastal pattern, with almost all exposures in counties within about~200
\si{\kilo\metre} (124~mi) of the coastline. While tropical cyclone rain
exposure was also more frequent in coastal areas compared to inland areas,
there were also inland exposures in counties not often  that were not
identified as exposed by the wind-based metric. Rain and, to some extent, flood
exposures were characterized by a pattern defined by the Appalachian Mountains,
with many fewer exposures west of the mountain range than to the east. Almost
all tornado-based exposures were in coastal states, with most in Florida,
Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina and almost none north of Maryland.
Flood-based exposures were highest in North Carolina and along the South
Carolina coast, as well as further north in New Jersey, southeastern
Pennsylvania, and southeastern New York. Notably, some areas of the \ac{US}
that experienced regular exposures to tropical cyclone-related excessive
rainfall and floods were not identified as areas of regular risk based on the
more commonly used tropical cyclone exposure assessment metrics of wind or
distance (Figure~\ref{fig:averageexposure}).  Patterns were similar when
analysis was restricted to years with exposure data for all four hazards
available (1996\,--\,2011; Figure~S3). 

\subsection*{Agreement across exposure metrics}

Next, we measured the agreement between exposure classifications for each pair
of metrics. We found that these exposure classifications typically did not
strongly agree between pairs of metrics. The set of counties
identified as ``exposed'' based on one metric often overlap little with
the set identified as ``exposed'' by another metric. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ivanexposure} shows shows an example: Hurricane Ivan in 2004.
For the distance-based metric, the counties assessed as exposed followed the
tropical cyclone's track, including counties well inland. For the wind metric,
only counties near two of the tropical cyclone's landfalls were assessed as
exposed. For rain- and flood-based metrics, however, exposure extended to the
left of the track, including counties as far north as New York and Connecticut,
while for the tornado metric, exposed counties tended to be to the right of the
track and included several counties in central North Carolina, South Carolina,
and Georgia that were not identified as exposed to Ivan based on any other
metric. Figure~S4 provides similar maps for four other example tropical
cyclones (selected because they exposed many \ac{US}  counties based on at
least one metric), and Figure~S5 provides four examples of tropical cyclones in
which the disagreement in exposure assessment between rain- and wind-based
metrics was particularly notable.

We drew similar conclusions when we investigated all~46 tropical cyclones
between~1996 and~2011 (the period for which data for all five metrics were
available) for which~250 or more counties were exposed based on at least one
metric (Figure~\ref{fig:jaccard}). In this figure, each row provides results
for one tropical cyclone, and each box in that row shows the measured Jaccard
coefficient a pair of exposure metrics. For most tropical cyclones,
distance-based county-level exposure assessment was, at best, in moderate
agreement with exposure assessments based on the four hazard-based metrics. For
almost all tropical cyclones, Jaccard index values between distance and any of
the four hazard-based metrics were~$\le0.6$ (i.e., out of the counties assessed
as exposed by at least one of the two metrics in the pair,~60\si{\percent} or
fewer were assessed the same under both metrics in the pair). For many tropical
cyclones, the Jaccard index values were~$\le0.2$, indicating poor agreement.
Among the four hazard-based metrics, the tornado-based metric had
universally poor agreement with other metrics in county-level classification
across the tropical cyclones considered.  For other pairs of metrics, there was
also generally disagreement in which counties were determined to be exposed,
with Jaccard index values~$<0.4$ for most metric pairs in most tropical
cyclones.

There were, however, exceptions\,---\,tropical cyclones in which exposure
assessment agreed well across several of the metrics considered.  For Floyd
in~1999 (Figure~S4) and Irene in~2011, for example, county-level classification
agreed moderately to well (Jaccard index of~$\sim 0.5\mbox{\,--\,}0.8$) for all
pairs of exposure metrics except those including the tornado-based metric. For
another set of tropical cyclones (e.g., Lee in~2011 [Figure~S3], Ernesto
in~2006, and Bertha in~1996), there was moderate to good agreement for all
pairwise combinations of distance, rain, and wind, but poor agreement for all
other combinations of metrics.  However, these two sets of tropical cyclones
represented the minority of tropical cyclones considered; for most tropical
cyclones, there was low overlap in the counties determined to be exposed to the
tropical cyclones between most pairings of metrics.

\subsection*{Case study}

We conducted a case study comparing estimates of physical exposure to
tropical cyclones that were measured using each exposure metric.
Figure~\ref{fig:topelecdependexposure} shows the study counties with the
highest expected physical exposures to tropical cyclones among
electricity-dependent Medicare beneficiaries based on each metric. A few
counties (Miami-Dade County, FL; Harris County, TX) were ranked in the top
three under almost all exposure metrics
(Figure~\ref{fig:topelecdependexposure}). However, there were key differences
across exposure metrics. For example, most of the top counties based on wind-
and tornado-based metrics were in Florida, while over half of the top counties
based on the flood-based metric were in Mid-Atlantic states (PA, NY).
