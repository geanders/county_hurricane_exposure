\contentsline {table}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Summary statistics for Exposure metrics considered to assess county-level exposure to tropical cyclones. A county exposure represents the exposure of a specific eastern U.S. county to a specific tropical storm. A county can be exposed to multiple storms within a year, and a storm can create multiple county exposures under a given metric. The median and internquartile range of county exposures per storm is based on the storms for which there was at least one county exposure under that metric. The years for which data are available for each metric are given in Table 1.}}{16}{table.2}
