Storms are displayed within
clusters that have similar patterns in county-level exposure agreement for
metric pairs, based on hierarchical clustering using the complete link
method~\parencite{murtagh2012algorithms} (i.e., storms in the same cluster tend
to have similar patterns for the pairwise strength of agreement among metrics);
columns are also ordered based on hierarchical clustering. 
Maps are
available showing the counties identified as exposed under each of five metrics
for the widest-extent storm in each cluster: Hurricane Ivan in~2004
(Figure~\ref{fig:ivanexposure}) and Hurricanes Floyd in~1999, Lee in~2011, Cindy
in~2005, and Katrina in~2005 (Figure~S4).
